# hello-world
my very first repository ... no glue what to include ;)

I'm living on this wonderful island called Bali - right at the beach where you can surf & get some fresh coconuts from the trees.
In November 2018 I decided to learn to code. First Html5, CSS and Javascript (on edX plattform), next I'm planning on learning Python.


I love fresh Mangos, fooling around with my Golden Retriever "Aldo" at the beach and of course surfing

Cheers  & let's go
